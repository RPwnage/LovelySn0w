# LovelySn0w
a iOS CVE-2018-4150 Application example. if this doesn't compile in XCode please message me on twitter. it's probably my fault then! it's not completetd at the moment. if you find 
```javascript
//ACPV ›(Some version) [...]
```
in the exploit.m file, the app will be ready for serious testing. That means that it does something to the file system. like extracting a .tar file to a specific folder. For those which don't get what i mean by that:
no, it's not a zip-app-free thing which extracts a .tar for you. it takes a file from the project and extracts for example, cydia.tar to /Applications. you might get it now..... or not.

# Current State

Compiles | Works | ACPV    | **FinalVersion** 
--- | -- | ---| ---
